# MCP-First Pivot Execution Ledger

This ledger is the durable handoff for the
[MCP-first pivot](mcp-first-pivot.md). Update the applicable entry in the same
commit as each roadmap task.

## Entry Format

```markdown
## Task N - Name
- Status: planned | active | blocked | complete
- Branch:
- Commits:
- Focused verification:
- Full verification:
- Deviations from plan:
- Follow-up risks:
```

## Task 1 - Record the pivot baseline and freeze dashboard surface growth

- Status: complete
- Branch: `pivot/1-establish-program`
- Commits: `3488d7a` (`docs: add MCP-first pivot design and roadmap`);
  `9a0d6ce` (`docs: establish MCP-first pivot program`)
- Focused verification: `python -m pytest tests/packaging/test_public_docs.py tests/cli/test_cli_release.py -q`
- Full verification: `npx markdownlint-cli2 README.md "docs/**/*.md" ".agent-maintainer/change-plans/*.md"`; `git diff --check`
- Deviations from plan: Approved design and implementation roadmap were adopted
  in a preliminary documentation commit to isolate their 4,209-line reviewed
  content from the Task 1 baseline changes.
- Follow-up risks: The release sequence assumes the published baseline remains
  `0.21.0`; shift all planned minors together if that changes before execution.

## Task 2 - Make public product and storage statements internally consistent

- Status: complete
- Branch: `pivot/2-position-product`
- Commits: `docs: position MCP as the primary product` (this commit)
- Focused verification: `python -m pytest tests/packaging/test_public_docs.py tests/cli/test_cli_release.py -q`; `python scripts/check_release.py`
- Full verification: `npx markdownlint-cli2 README.md "docs/**/*.md"`; `git diff --check`
- Deviations from plan: The local Task 2 branch is intentionally stacked on the
  reviewed Task 1 commits because pushing and merging are outside this task.
- Follow-up risks: Rebase or recreate the branch from updated `main` after Task 1
  merges; do not drop the Task 1 baseline and review-fix commits.

## Remaining Planned Tasks

Tasks 3 through 45 remain planned in the approved implementation roadmap. Add a
full entry using the format above when each task becomes active; do not mark a
task complete without its named focused and full verification evidence.
